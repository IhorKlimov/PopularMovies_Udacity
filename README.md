# PopularMovies_Udacity

An app which I'm making during Udacity - Developing Adndroid Apps course.

I use Apiary Movie Database API to get movies data in JSON format http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#
And Picasso Image Downloading and caching library for posters http://square.github.io/picasso/

In order for you to use it you need to get an Apiary DB API key and put in in code
